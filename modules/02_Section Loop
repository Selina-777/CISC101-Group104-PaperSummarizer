**Goal:**  
Iterate over each section and generate constrained, PS2-compliant section summaries and metadata.

**Inputs:**

- Normalized sections and text from Module 1.
- Summary Level (detailed, short)
- Configuration (word limits, audience, purpose).
- Guardrail rules (from Module 3).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- For each section in order:
  - Extract the corresponding text.
  - If: 
    Summary level = "short" then Generate a **≤ 50-word** summary that uses simple terminology and respects PS2 constraints.
    Summary level = "detailed" then Generate a **≤ 50-word** summary that uses simple terminology and respects PS2 constraints, and also present key concepts in a 2-5 point bullet list. 
  - Identify key concepts, methods, or results when present.
  - Mark any special conditions (e.g., missing, too short, truncated).
- Collect glossary candidates (terms or phrases that may need explanation).

**Outputs:**

- A mapping: `SectionName → SectionSummaryData`, where each `SectionSummaryData` includes:
  - Section name.
  - If: 
    Summary level = "short" present a **≤ 50-word** summary text
    Summary level = "detailed" present a **≤ 50-word** summary text and a 3-5 point bullet list of key points
  - Key concepts / methods.
  - Local warnings (missing, too short, partial).
- A list of potential glossary terms.
