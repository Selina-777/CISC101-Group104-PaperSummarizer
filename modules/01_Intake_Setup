**Goal:**  
Process and validate user inputs, normalize sections, and construct a clean internal representation of the paper and configuration.

**Inputs:**

- Paper Name.
- Raw paper text or section-level chunks.
- Section list requested by the user.
- Summary purpose for general audience.
- Desired short length (which must not violate PS2 word limits).
- Audience type (expert, lay, or both).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Normalize section names (e.g., “Intro” → “Introduction”, “Conclusions” → “Conclusion”).
- Detect **missing sections**: requested by the user but absent from the text.
- Detect **short sections**: sections that may be extremely brief (e.g., less than some threshold such as 50 words).
- Validate that requested lengths are compatible with:
  - Per-section maximum = 50 words.
  - Unified summary maximum = 500 words.
- Build an internal structure (e.g., ordered list) that preserves **original section order**.

**Outputs:**

- A normalized, ordered list of sections with status tags (e.g., `present`, `missing`, `too_short`).
- A configuration object containing:
  - Word limit parameters (section and total).
  - Audience and purpose.
  - Flags for chunking/long-paper mode.
- Cleaned text for each section (or placeholder markers for missing sections).
