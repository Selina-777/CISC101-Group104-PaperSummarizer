**Goal:**  
Help users see which references are central to the paper without fabricating any citations.

**Inputs:**

- Full or partial paper text, especially Related Work and References sections.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Identify in-text citations and the most frequently mentioned works.
- Extract citation details **only** from the text (author names, year, partial titles if visible).
- Avoid inventing or completing missing citation details.
- Flag references that appear truncated or incomplete.

**Outputs:**

- A brief “Key References” list that:
  - Shows partial citations as they appear in the text.
  - Notes any truncation or missing information.
- Optional integration with:
  - Mini-Glossary (e.g., glossary terms linked to key references).
  - Checks & Warnings (e.g., “References section incomplete in provided text.”).
