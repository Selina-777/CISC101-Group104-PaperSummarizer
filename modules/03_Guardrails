**Goal:**  
Apply and record safety and quality constraints: missing/empty sections, short sections, hallucination mitigation, and long-paper chunking behavior.

**Inputs:**

- Section list and statuses from Module 1.
- Section summaries and metadata from Module 2.
- Raw text signals (e.g., chunk boundaries for long papers).

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Missing / empty sections:**
  - Confirm and record which requested sections have no usable content.
  - Ensure output clearly indicates “Section missing” rather than guessing.
- **< 50-word sections:**
  - Detect sections with extremely brief source text, and annotate them with caution (e.g., “Source text very short, summary may be limited.”).
- **Hallucination mitigation:**
  - Enforce rules:
    - Summaries must only describe information grounded in the provided text.
    - For unclear points, instruct to say “Not specified in the provided text.”
  - Provide patterns of cautious phrasing.
- **Long-paper chunking:**
  - Outline and apply strategies for handling chunked input:
    - Per-chunk processing.
    - Aggregation of chunk-level summaries into a coherent final summary while respecting the 50-word and 500-word limits.
  - Track which sections may span multiple chunks.

**Outputs:**

- A structured list of **global warnings** (e.g., missing sections, truncated text).
- Guardrail annotations attached to each section summary.
- Guidance for how **Checks & Warnings** should be expressed in the final
